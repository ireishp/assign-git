What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project? 
A gitignore file is a file which tells git which files/folders can be ignored in a project. 
For a java project, the gitignore file can include a list of class files, package files (like .jar, .war, etc), and crash logs. 


What does fast-forward in git mean?
Git fast forward is when we try to merge a commit that can be reached by following a previous commit history. Hence, git simply moves the pointer forward as there is nothing new to merge together. 


Why should you have different branches?
We have different branches so that when working in a team, each developer can work on his/her code independently, without affecting other team members' code. It also helps us to maintain different versions of the code.


In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
We usually have ONE remote repository.
